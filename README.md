# Professional README.md Generator

Welcome to my professional readme generator !
The latest in homework assignments from the bootcamp, this is a simple javascript application that
can/must be run directly from the terminal using node.js!
Simply answer the prompts and your readme.md file will be generated in your working directory/on your
local computer.

## Motivation

Coincidentally, I had been previously thinking of ways to automatically generate portfolios, and sure
enough the mini project before this assignment was doing exactly that, so it was awesome to be able to 
apply those same concepts to this "Professional README.md Generator".

This was the homework assignment for week 9, and I will admit it was a loooooooot harder than I had
originally expected. There is a lot of motivation to fully learn all the concepts that are being 
applied, and I was really struggling until the last minute, which really just gave way to more internal
motivation to succeed and do well. 

I always want to receive good grades on assignmnents, it's something I take pride in, I also take pride
in my work and in learning new things, so to be able to showcase what I've been learning so far in  the 
bootcamp is very delightful.

## Build Status

This application is a terminal-run one, different than the previous assignments which have all been deployed
live hosted on github, however this one does not have an html file, therefore it can't be web-run. Instead, the
application is ran from terminal (mac users) and from the git bash (windows users). As long as your computer 
is running (will be running on your local server), and as long as you have node installed, you'll be able to 
run this program and generate your own professional README.md.

## Code Style

Functional, definitely employed the use of methods and functions we'd just learned in the last couple weeks. 
Procedural and logical as well because the app follows a certain step-by-step process, but also has components
that are dependent on user-input. 

## Video Demo and Screenshots

Please click on this link to watch a video on how to access, run, and use the app: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/9oFPrpzZUMDZkO4Icq4P

Below are some screenshots as well:

### Installation:

### Tests:

Use node.js (make sure it's installed), in the terminal, navigate to the develop folder after you've cloned the reposirtory into your local computer so you have the same files, and then use "node index.js" to test, and run 
the application. As long as you don't change anything you shouldn't right after cloning, the app should run every
time.
